# 🏡 Property Booking Platform

## 🏁 Project Goal

This Property Booking Platform is a **full-stack web application** that allows users to **search, view, and book properties** such as hotels, flats, guest houses, rooms, and more. The platform connects **hosts** who want to rent out their properties with **guests** looking for comfortable accommodations for travel or short-term stays.

It is designed to simplify the booking process and ensure a smooth experience for both parties — whether you're a traveler finding a place to stay or a host listing your property for rent.
